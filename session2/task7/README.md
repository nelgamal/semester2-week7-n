# Task 7

In this task, you'll use everything you've learned during the week to
investigate and debug a larger C application. The code for this application
can be found in `pgm_tools.c`.

The application can be used to perform simple image processing operations on
grayscale images. It loads an image from disk, then offers the user a menu of
different processing options. After processing the image in the required
manner, the user is prompted to enter a filename. The processed image is then
saved to disk as a file with that specified name.

## Background Information

**PGM (Portable Gray Map)** is part of a [family of simple file formats][netpbm]
that can be used for the storage of images.

PGM is actually _two_ file formats, one text-based and the other binary. We
consider only the text-based format here.

PGM files are suitable for storing grayscale images - i.e., images in which
each pixel is a single integer, representing a shade of gray. This ranges
from a minimum of 0 (black) up to a specified maximum value (white). The
maximum is usually 255, allowing for 256 distinct shades of gray for each
pixel.

A text-based PGM file consists of:

- The string "P2", which identifies the file as a text-based PGM image
- An optional comment line, starting with a `#` character
- Width and height dimensions
- Maximum gray value
- A grid of pixel values representing the image

Here's the example from Wikipedia's page on the PGM format:

```

0  3  3  3  0  0  0  7  7  7  0  0  0 11 11 11  0  0  0 15 15 15 15  0
0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  0 11  0  0  0  0  0 15  0  0  0  0
0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  7  7  7  0  0 11 11 11 11  0  0 15  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0

```

And here's what the resulting image looks like, magnified for clarity:

## Setting Up Your Environment

In GitHub Codespaces, you may find it helpful to install a PGM viewer extension
to visualise your images:

1. Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X)
2. Search for "PBM Viewer" (this supports PBM, PGM, and PPM formats)
3. Install the extension
4. After installation, you can right-click on any `.pgm` file and select
   "Open with PBM Viewer"

This will allow you to see the actual images instead of just the raw text data.

## Your Task

1. Use the provided makefile to compile the application, then try running
   it on some of the `.pgm` files in the `images` subdirectory. This should
   reveal some problems.

2. Use GDB and the other tools explored this week to investigate the nature
   of these problems. Then fix them.
